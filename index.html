Minecraft is a sandbox video game created by Swedish game developer Markus Persson and released by 
Mojang in 2011. The game allows players to build with a variety of different blocks in a 3D procedurally 

generated world, requiring creativity from players. Other activities in the game include exploration,
 resource gathering, crafting, and combat. Multiple game modes that change gameplay are available,
  including—but not limited to—a survival mode, in which players must acquire resources to build the
   world and maintain health, and a creative mode, where players have unlimited resources to build with.
    The Java Edition of the game allows players to modify the game with mods to create new gameplay
     mechanics, items, textures and assets.

Minecraft received critical acclaim and has won numerous awards and accolades. Social media,
 parodies, adaptations, merchandise, and the MineCon convention played large roles in popularizing
  the game. It has also been used in educational environments (Minecraft Education Edition), especially 
  in the realm of computing systems, as virtual computers and hardware devices have been built in it.
   By May 2019, over 176 million copies had been sold across all platforms, making it the best-selling
    video game of all time. In September 2014, Microsoft announced a deal to buy Mojang and the
     Minecraft intellectual property for US$2.5 billion, with the acquisition completed two months
      later. A spin-off game titled Minecraft: Story Mode has also been released. By mid-2018, the 
      game had around 91 million active players monthly.

Gameplay
Minecraft is a 3D sandbox game that has no specific goals to accomplish, allowing players
 a large amount of freedom in choosing how to play the game.[20] However, there is an achievement system.]
 
 [21] Gameplay is in the first-person perspective by default, but players have the option for third-person
  perspective.[22] The game world is composed of rough 3D objects—mainly cubes and fluids, and commonly 
  called "blocks"—representing various materials, such as dirt, stone, ores, tree trunks, water, and lava.
   The core gameplay revolves around picking up and placing these objects. These blocks are arranged in
    a 3D grid, while players can move freely around the world. Players can "mine" blocks and then place
     them elsewhere, enabling them to build things.[23]

The game world is virtually infinite and procedurally generated as players explore it, using a map seed 
that is obtained from the system clock at the time of world creation (or manually specified by the player)
.[24][25][26] There are limits on vertical movement, but Minecraft allows an infinitely large game world
 to be generated on the horizontal plane. Due to technical problems when extremely distant locations are
  reached, however, there is a barrier preventing players from traversing to locations beyond 30,000,000
   blocks.[nb 1] The game achieves this by splitting the world data into smaller sections called "chunks"
    that are only created or loaded when players are nearby.[24] The world is divided into biomes ranging 
    from deserts to jungles to snowfields;[27][28] the terrain includes plains, mountains, forests, caves,
     and various lava/water bodies.[26] The in-game time system follows a day and night cycle, and one 
     full cycle lasts 20 real-time minutes.

 and skeleton.
Players encounter various non-player characters known as mobs, such as animals, villagers, and hostile 
creatures.[29] Passive mobs can be hunted for food and crafting materials, such as cows, pigs, and chickens. They spawn in the daytime, while hostile mobs spawn during nighttime or in dark places such as caves—including large spiders, skeletons, and zombies.[26] Some hostile mobs such as zombies, skeletons and drowned (underwater versions of zombies), burn under the sun if they have no headgear.[30] Other creatures unique to Minecraft include the creeper (an exploding creature that sneaks up on the player) and the enderman (a creature with the ability to teleport, pick up, and place blocks).[31] There are also variants of mobs that spawn in different conditions, for example zombies have husk variants that spawn in deserts.[32]

Many commentators have described the game's physics system as unrealistic.[33] Liquids continuously flow 
for a limited horizontal distance from source blocks, which can be removed by placing a solid block in
 its place or by scooping it into a bucket. Complex systems can be built using primitive mechanical
  devices, electrical circuits, and logic gates built with an in-game material known as redstone.[34]

Minecraft has two alternative dimensions besides the overworld (the main world): the Nether and the End
.[31] The Nether is a hell-like dimension accessed via player-built portals; it contains many unique
 resources and can be used to travel great distances in the overworld.[35] The player can build an
  optional boss mob called the Wither out of materials found in the Nether.[36] The End is a barren
   land consisting of many islands. A boss dragon called the Ender Dragon dwells on the main island.
   [37] Killing the dragon cues the game's ending credits and a poem written by Irish novelist Julian
    Gough.[38] Players are then allowed to teleport back to their original spawn point in the overworld
     and continue the game indefinitely.[39]

The game consists of five game modes: survival, creative, adventure, hardcore, and spectator. It also
 has a changeable difficulty system of four levels. For example, the peaceful difficulty prevents hostile
  creatures from spawning, and when playing on the hard difficulty players can starve to death if their
   hunger bar is depleted.[40][41]
